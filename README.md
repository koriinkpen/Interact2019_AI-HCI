## Motivation

As more and more artificial intelligent systems become incorporated into our every-day lives, it is critical that we understand the ways in which people will interact with these systems. Although some AI systems will be fully automated, a large number will be incorporated into a larger social ecosystem where people will be interacting with these systems.  In some cases, advances in machine learning are enabling systems to make inferences on data that are more precise than human experts, however, there is also a growing body of literature that shows that these systems have inherent bias and can have a negative impact on human decision making [3]. It is imperative that researchers understand the smart interplay of AI systems and human experts such that the combination of the two can leverage the inherent strength and weaknesses of each to lead to optimal results. In this workshop, we seek to bring together researchers from both Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction communities to discuss concepts, systems, designs, and empirical studies focusing on the communication and cooperation between individual users and teams of users with AI systems.

## Call for Participation

**We invite submissions for a one-day workshop to discuss critical questions related to Human+AI Collaboration in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.**

Papers should be **2-4 pages long** according to the INTERACT 2019 ([Springer LNCS Series](https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)) format, and may address any topics related to the workshop [Themes](#themes). This includes but is not limited to ongoing work; reflections on past work; combining methods from HCI and design to AI; and emergent ethical, political, and social challenges. 

The **due date for submissions is no later than 26 April, 2019**  (*submission method to be confirmed*). Participants will be selected based on the quality and clarity of their submissions as they reflect the interests of the workshop. Notifications will go out no later than 7 June, 2019. At least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop, and all participants must register for both the workshop and at least one day of the conference.

An expert panel of 3-4 researchers will be recruited to review the submissions and participate in the conference.Participants will be selected based on their prior experience and interest in the workshop as well as the quality of their submissions. We will focus on recruiting from a diverse group of participants, with a balance of students and faculty; industry practitioners and academic audiences; contribution areas within HCI and AI research; and representation of different cultures, genders, and ethnic backgrounds.

## Objectives and Target Audience

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse communities such as Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Interaction Design, Group Decision Support Systems, Visualisation, Philosophy and Ethics. This workshop will build on the insights gained from a larger workshop we are organising at CHI 2019 [aka.ms/whereisthe human](http://aka.ms/whereisthehuman), but focus in more specifically in issues related to Human+AI interaction.  

The structure of this workshop will be focused on creating research partnerships and identifying collaborative projects.  Although we will spend time discussing key trends, challenges, and opportunities, the overall goal is to have a focused workshop that will initiate projects that will extend beyond the workshop itself. The intimate nature of workshops at INTERACT is an ideal venue for this type of workshop. 


## Themes

This workshop will focus on three sub-themes related to Human + AI Collaboration: 

1.  **Integrating Artificial and Human Intelligence**: AI systems and humans both have unique abilities and are typically better at certain complementary tasks than others. For instance, while AI systems can summarize voluminous data to identify latent patterns, humans can extract meaningful, relatable, and theoretically grounded insights from such patterns. What kind of research designs or problems are most amenable to and would benefit the most from combining artificial and human intelligence? What challenges might surface in attempting to do so? How do issues of trust and accountability impact results \[5, 7\]?

2.  **Collaborative Decision Making:** How can we harness the best of humans and algorithms to make better decisions than either alone? How do we ensure that when there is a human-in-the-loop—such as in complex or life-changing decision-making—they remain critical and meaningful, while creating and maintaining an enjoyable user experience? Where is the line between decision support anticipating the needs of the user and it removing the user’s ability to bring in novel, qualitative critical knowledge to enable the system’s goals?

3.  **Explainable and Explorable AI**: What does the human need to effectively utilize AI insights? How can users explore AI systems’ results and logic to identify failure modes that might not be easy to spot? Examples might be undesirable impacts on latent groups not corresponding to categories in the dataset \[6\], difficult-to-spot changes (‘concept drift’), or feedback loops in the socio-technical phenomena the AI system is modelling over time \[2\].

## Expected Outcomes

Three key outcomes are expected from this workshop. First, community building and networking among key researchers in the area of Human+AI collaboration, with the potential to lead to future collaborations on projects or larger grant proposals.  Second, an outline of important research directions for this emerging area. Third, one or more research projects that will continue beyond the workshop, the results of which will be published in premiere research venues.
